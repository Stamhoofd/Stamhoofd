	// This context will be passed to all methods. It doesn't fulfill a real purpose in the standard library but could be used
	// to abort database lookups or similar things.
	ctx := req.Context()

	// Let's create an AuthorizeRequest object!
	// It will analyze the request and extract important information like scopes, response type and others.
	ar, err := oauth2Provider.NewAuthorizeRequest(ctx, req)
	if err != nil {
		logrus.Errorf("%v", err)
		oauth2Provider.WriteAuthorizeError(rw, ar, err)

	// Normally, this would be the place where you would check if the user is logged in and gives his consent.
	// We're simplifying things and just checking if the request includes a valid username and password
	if req.Form.Get("username") != "andreas" {
		oauth2Provider.WriteAuthorizeError(rw, ar, errors.New("Invalid username"))
		return
	}

	// Now that the user is authorized, we set up a session. When validating / looking up tokens, we additionally get
	// the session. You can store anything you want in it.

	// The session will be persisted by the store and made available when e.g. validating tokens or handling token endpoint requests.
	// The default OAuth2 and OpenID Connect handlers require the session to implement a few methods. Apart from that, the
	// session struct can be anything you want it to be.
	mySessionData := &fosite.DefaultSession{
		Username: req.Form.Get("username"),
	}

	// It's also wise to check the requested scopes, e.g.:
	// if authorizeRequest.GetScopes().Has("admin") {
	//     http.Error(rw, "you're not allowed to do that", http.StatusForbidden)
	//     return
	// }

	// Now we need to get a response. This is the place where the AuthorizeEndpointHandlers kick in and start processing the request.
	// NewAuthorizeResponse is capable of running multiple response type handlers which in turn enables this library
	// to support open id connect.
	response, err := oauth2Provider.NewAuthorizeResponse(ctx, ar, mySessionData)
	if err != nil {
		oauth2Provider.WriteAuthorizeError(rw, ar, err)
		return
	}

	// Awesome, now we redirect back to the client redirect uri and pass along an authorize code
	oauth2Provider.WriteAuthorizeResponse(rw, ar, response)
}

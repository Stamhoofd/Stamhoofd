# Stamhoofd structures

This repository contains all the data structures that are used to communicate with the Stamhoofd API and to store data in (encrypted) json files and in the database. Encoding, decoding and versioning is handled by the @simonbackx/simple-encoding library.

We'll add more documentation in the future here.
